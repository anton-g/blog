Hi, I'm Anton.

I make stuff over at [Lyxit](http://lyxit.se), study information systems in [Swedens fourth largest city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppsala) and hopefully I'll be writing about stuff here.

So, this is my blog. Why a blog?

* I want to try [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).
* I want to write more Markdown.
* I want a place to document the progress I'm making on my new hobbyist [game]({% post_url 2016-04-04-hello %}).

And hence, this blog was born. I'm not sure how often i'll get to update it, but i'm going to try my best.

Cheers
