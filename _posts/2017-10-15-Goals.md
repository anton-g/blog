> "This blog has now been alive for over a year without me writing a single blog post.
> It's about time that changed." - Me

I wrote that about two months ago, posted the first "real" blogpost about 2 weeks later and then.. nothing. I could blame this on having a lot of stuff going on at work, that I've moved to a new apartment or just about anything but the truth is that it would be a lie. 

The truth is that I haven't prioritized blogging even though I've had more time at my hands than before. It's not that I don't want to write, I just dont allocate the time to do it.

When I (re)started this blog I set up a couple of goals for myself, which I obviously haven't reached. That's why I'm gonna try the *psychological trick* of putting pressure on myself by publishing the goals for the world to see. 

__Goals for the first year:__
- Write at least one blog post every two weeks.
- Write at least one "meatier" technical post every two months.

It's nothing fancy and should really not be that hard to keep up with.  
So, here we go again.
