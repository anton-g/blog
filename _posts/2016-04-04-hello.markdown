So this is my new blog. Why a blog? Good question. Here's my reasoning:  
<!--more-->

* I want to try [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).
* I want to write more Markdown.
* I want a place to document the progress i'm making with my new game.

And hence, this blog was born. I'm not sure how often i'll get to update it, but i'm going to try my best.

So what's this game i'm talking about? It's a *co-op puzzle platformer* and so far without a name.
Here is a gif from a recent build:

Well, i think thats it for now. I'm going to try and write a blogpost about how i achieved the beams in the gif.
We'll see if i find the time, but thats the way the cookie crumbles.
