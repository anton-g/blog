Getting your characters to feel alive is a monumental task..  <!--more-->
So i've been thinking about this for quite some time while working on other parts of the game. But after posting a first gif over at reddit ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity2D/comments/4d1xga/a_sample_level_from_my_wip_coop_platformer/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/4d2l8c/a_sample_level_from_my_wip_coop_platformer_xpost/)) and getting some valuable feedback, i felt like it was time to stop writing game mechanics and do something else for a while. I ended up working on how the characters appear and improved three things:

- Eyes blink every now and then.
- Eyes subtly follow your movement. So you look the way you walk, jump, fall etc.
- Players are stretched and squeezed slighty when jumping. This doesn't however affect the collisions, but it's a nice little detail.

Here's how these three changes turned out:

It doesn't really show in the gif since it's quite low quality, but it makes the world of difference when playing. Your character feels much more alive

Thanks for reading.
