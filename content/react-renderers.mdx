Live notes on creating a custom renderer in React.

## Creating a renderer

To create a React `renderer` you implement the [`react-reconciler`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-reconciler) package:

## Renderer vs reconciler

Sometimes `renderers` are incorrectly called `reconcilers` but reconciliation and rendering are separate things. The reconciler (which is React internal) determines which part of a tree has changed, while renderers use the reconciled tree to render the app. ([1](https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture#reconciliation-versus-rendering), [2](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1286008969429954560), [3](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html))

## A few renderers

- [react-dom](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-dom): renders components to the DOM.
- [react-native-renderer](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-native-renderer): renders components to native views.
- [ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink): renders components to the command-line.
- [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber): renders [three.js](https://threejs.org/) in a React environment.
