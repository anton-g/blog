## Intro

We'll look at examples of ten different code smells in react components. Opinionated bla bla

## Table of contents

- 1
- 2
- 3

## 1 Too many props

a sign that the component might need to be split.

Solutions:

- Pass down an `options` object
- break the component up into multiple components
- use composition

## 2 Props that doesn't work with each other

`autoCapitalize` + `type:tel`
Solutions:

- Break up into multiple components

## 3 Shared state

ie duplicating the component and it shares state it shouldn't
Navbar never duplicated? Think again, animations
Solutions:

- Remove the shared state, make sure you can use multiple instances of the component

## 4 copying props into state

Don't stop the data flow: For example copying props into state, meaning that when props change the state isn't updated. (Constructor: state.x = prop.x)

naming initialColor or defaultColor

## 5 Large "data" props

Passing data instead of composing (See Composable components → tabs)

## 6 (Not) prop drilling

Deep prop drilling (Passing down blabla, pass down the component instead, profilepicture ie)
Advanced patterns when prop drilling is just fine

## 7 JSX in methods

JSX rendered from methods (Move to separate component, or even functions outside component)
Components doesn't have to be moved to separate file, if tightly coupled

## 8 Booleans for state

Avoid booleans for state
Solutions:

- state string

## 9 useState jungle

Many many useState ⇒ useReducer
Solutions:

- useReducer

## 10 Large useEffects

Large useEffects, makes it hard to reason about the code. With smaller useEffects it's more natural:
"When [dependencies] change do -this-"
Solutions:

- Break up into smaller useEffects
