A collection of things I consider code smells in react components. All opinionated of course, so would love to hear if you (dis)agree or have other suggestions.

## Too many props

Passing too many props into a single component may be a sign that the component should be split up.

Fixes:

- Pass down an `options` object
- Break the component up into multiple components
- Use composition

## Incompatible props

Avoid passing props that are incompatible with each other.

For example we might start by creating a common `<Input />` component that is intended to just handle text, but after a while we also add the possibility to use it for phone numbers as well. The implementation could look something like this:

```jsx
function Input({ value, isPhoneNumberInput, autoCapitalize }) {
  if (autoCapitalize) capitalize(value)

  return <input value={value} type={isPhoneNumberInput ? 'tel' : 'text'} />
}
```

The problem with this is that the props `isPhoneNumberInput` and `autoCapitalize` doesn't make sense together. We can't really capitalize phone numbers.

One solution to this is to break the component up into multiple smaller components. If we still have some logic we want to share between them, we can move it to a [custom hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html):

```jsx
function TextInput({ value, autoCapitalize }) {
  if (autoCapitalize) capitalize(value)
  useSharedInputLogic()

  return <input value={value} type="text" />
}

function PhoneNumberInput({ value }) {
  useSharedInputLogic()

  return <input value={value} type="tel" />
}
```

While this example is a bit contrived, finding props that are incompatible with each other are usually a good indication that you should check if the component needs to be broken apart.

## Shared state

ie duplicating the component and it shares state it shouldn't
Navbar never duplicated? Think again, animations! ðŸ’«

Fixes:

- Remove the shared state, make sure you can use multiple instances of the component

## Copying props into state

Don't stop the data flow: For example copying props into state, meaning that when props change the state isn't updated. (Constructor: state.x = prop.x)

When intentional, use standard naming like initialColor or defaultColor.

## Large "data" props

Passing data instead of composing (See Composable components â†’ tabs)

## (Not) prop drilling

Prop drilling is usually just fine but sometimes there's better alternatives.

- Use composition (pass down component as prop)
- Use context api (when state is shared "horizontally")

## Returning JSX from functions

Splitting up a compoents JSX into multiple functions makes it hard to reason about the code, and is a clear example of a time where we probably want to create a new component instead.

Components doesn't have to be moved to separate file, if tightly coupled?

## Multiple booleans for state

Avoid using multiple booleans to represent a components state. Most of the time it's easier to replace them with a single enum/string.

Fixes:

- `useState('loading')`

## Too many useState in a component

Many many useState

Fixes:

- useReducer

## Large useEffect

Large useEffects, makes it hard to reason about the code. With smaller useEffects it's more natural:
"When [dependencies] change do -this-"

Fixes:

- Break up into multiple smaller useEffects
