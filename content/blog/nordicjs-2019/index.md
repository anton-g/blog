A few weeks ago I attended the developer conference [NordicJS](https://nordicjs.com) for the first time. I've been to quite a few other conferences in Sweden since I started working as a developer, but I have to say that this was something else. There was this very welcoming and positive feeling in the air and among the attendees that I haven't experienced anywhere before.

All the talks was of very high quality and I can recommend watching them all, but below are a few thoughts on the talks that resonated with me the most.

## Value Driven Development

###### by Isa Silveira

The very first talk of the conference was Isa Silveira talking about Value Driven Development and opening the talk in a very personal, authentic and vulerable way. She talked about meeting her current partner at last years NordicJS, moving to Sweden from Brazil and using that as a segway into the core of the talk, value driven development.

She talked about how we as developers have an accountability for what we do but that we're also in a position of power in todays society. How are we gonna shift our culture from being solution driven to value driven? And can we use software as a tool to reduce human suffering?

The talk was a great start of the conference and really set the tone for the next two days, and I wholeheartedly recommend watching it.

## Gettin’ into the (Tensor)Flow

###### by Piérre Reimertz

I've tried to learn TensorFlow way to many times, and failed way to many times. I've never found a tutorial or introduction that was light hearted enough to keep me inspired but still compact enough to actually teach me something. But along came Piérres talk at NordicJS.

By combining a fun, practical introduction to real life examples of machine learning with an introduction to the internals of TensorFlow(.js) we get an excellent talk using machine learning as a web developer.

I can't say that I know TensorFlow after watching this talk, but I feel that I have better foundation and I'm definately more inspired to try and learn TensorFlow.js again.

## Build dumb sh\*t

###### by Sara Vieira

Finishing off the entire conference was this amazing talk by the **hilarious** Sara Vieira about "building dumb shit". I don't want to go into to much details about the talk because I believe it's much better if you watch it for yourself. But I'll say that you'll hear about (not) making the world a better place, why useless is not worthless, what an NPM drinking game looks like and much much more. Just watch it.

It was a perfect mix of serious and silly and ended up being my favorite talk of the conference. So inspiring and motivating that at a hackathon a week later I developed a chrome extension that screams back when you scream at your computer ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

#### Finally

The entire conference was live streamed at Twitch ([day 1](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/492603232) & [day 2](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/493016688)) and all videos have also been uploaded to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/nordicjs). It was by far the greatest conference I've attended so if you get the chance to attend I highly recommend it.
