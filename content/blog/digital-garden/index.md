I really like writing things here, but I usually put to much pressure on myself about the quality, length and how interesting the content has to be. This have led to me writing much less than I'd like, so the last couple of months I've been thinking about how to fix that and I've settled on using the idea of a _digital garden_.

What is a digital garden? Joel Hooks have a great [post](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) on it, where he describes it like this:

> The phrase "digital garden" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the resulting "showpiece" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there.

So this post is the first where I try this. Publishing without considering it done. Dropping the idea that it has to be interesting. Just writing.

A very incomplete list of things that I'd like to implement or try out while doing this rebuild:

- Tag posts
- Post search
- Webmentions

And some reading and inspiration while we're at it:
