description: 'A short retrospective of the past decade'
---

I'm usually not one for doing huge retrospectives but I got caught up in a conversation with a friend about what we've done this past decade realized I easily forget what I've accomplished. So to much of my own benefit, here's a short run through of the past 10 years of my life.

## 2010

I graduated high school at Staffangymnasiet in SÃ¶derhamn, where I've grown up and lived my entire life up to this point. After a short summer break I got a job as a customer service agent at a telecom company.

## 2011

Met my first serious girlfriend and moved to my first apartment. I was promoted to work with second-line support (ie the _tough stuff_).

## 2012

I was promoted to work with educations before moving to Uppsala where I got a job as a telemarketer selling insurance.

## 2013

After 6 months of telemarketing my employer realized I was a horrible telemarketer so I got fired. Started working from home with customer service for Apple, before starting studies in Informatics at Uppsala University.

## 2014

I was one of two project leaders for the student orientation for Informatics students, and later that year I was elected vice president of the Informatics Student Association. Also started a company called Lyxit with a friend where we did some consultancy work but mainly developed apps and games.

## 2015

Continued my studies. Had a short project employment over the summer building a hybrid app with [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/).

## 2016

I graduated University and started my first real developer job at a company called Avanade Sweden. In November me and a couple of university friends decided to start a Swedish podcast, [Still in Beta](https://podcasts.apple.com/se/podcast/still-in-beta/id1174070946), about being a rookie developer.

## 2017

Me and my girlfriend broke up. Me and my friend decided it was time to officially kill our company Lyxit after quite some time of inactivity.

## 2018

During the summer I realized that I wasn't happy at work and started thinking about moving on so I started looking for new opportunities. Two years and 20 episodes after starting our podcast Still in Beta was shut down.

## 2019

In February I started my new job at [Mpya Digital](https://www.mpyadigital.com), which so far feels like it might be the best decision of the decade.

## 2020?

At the end of 2019 I was quite exhausted as a result of doing a bit too much of everything at the same time. But after some time offline from everything over the holidays I'm going into this new year and new decade with such a positive energy, feeling better than I've done in years.

I'll get back to you in 10 years with how it went.
