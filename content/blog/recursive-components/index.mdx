import Folders from './components/Folders'

I always had a hard time understanding recursive _functions_ when I stumbled upon them while learning to code. While I've got a better understanding today I don't use them much since they most often makes the code harder to read and reason about.

A recursive function is a function that invokes itself so a recursive component is in it's essence a component that renders itself. One place where recursive components comes in handy is when implementing features that deal with tree-like data, for example a nested menu, comments with hierarchy or as we'll implement in this post; a component that displays a folder structure like this:

<Folders />

> While we will use React to implement this component it's possible to build recursive components in all other modern JS frameworks too.

Before we get started, let's talk just a little bit about recursion and the data we'll use in this example.
