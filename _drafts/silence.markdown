About a year ago i developed an app called *Charades - Hysterical randomized fun* which is a take on the classic charades game where you have to be silent and explain some word or sentence using just your body. What sets my app apart from the ocean of other charade-apps out there is that every charade is a randomized combination of different words that results in a total of about **3 000 000** different combinations.<!--more-->

Up until now the app have only been available in swedish, but i thought that some of you still might be interested in the download statistics since the launch. I'm going to try and explain the trends and be completely transparent with sales and downloads.

Since launch in numbers:

- Downloaded over 5000 times
- Total revenue of XXX (free download, 1 in-app purchase)
- XXX avarage daily users

I have just released a new version with **english** and **norwegian** translations of all the charades. If anyone found this interesting and want to try the app you can find it at the [App Store](here) (No android version, sorry!).

Thanks for reading.
