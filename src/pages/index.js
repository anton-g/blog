          <h3>Hello, I'm Anton! ðŸ‘‹</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a web developer from Stockholm, Sweden and I've been passionate
            about programming ever since I discovered that by writing words in a
            certain order, I could tell the computer what to do! ðŸ˜± It was just
            like magic! âœ¨
          </p>
          <p>
            This is my personal site where I try to keep track of my personal{' '}
            <Link to="/projects">projects</Link> and occasionally post stuff on
            my <Link to="/posts">blog</Link>. The posts are usually just a
            slightly edited version of my own notes from learning the subjects,
            and therefore probably not complete neither comprehensive, but
            hopefully, they'll serve a purpose to someone!
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have any questions or just want to talk (or meet up if you're
            ever in Stockholm!), it's easiest to reach me on{' '}
            <a href="https://twitter.com/awnton">Twitter (@awnton)</a>. ðŸŽ‰
          </p>
          <p>Have a day full of joy!</p>
