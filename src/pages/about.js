          <p>
            I'm a full stack-developer from Stockholm, Sweden and I've been
            passionate about programming ever since I discovered that by writing
            words in a certain order, I could tell the computer what to do! ðŸ˜±
            It was just like magic! âœ¨
          </p>
          <p>
            This is my personal site where I try to show off my personal
            projects and occasionally posts on the blog. The posts are usually
            just a slighty edited version of my own notes from learning the
            subjects, and therefore probably not complete neither comprehensive,
            but hopefully they'll serve a purpose to someone!
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have any questions or just want to talk (or meet up if you're
            ever in Stockholm!), it's easiest to reach me on{' '}
            <a href="">Twitter (@awnton)</a>. ðŸŽ‰
          </p>
          <p>Have a wonderful day!</p>
