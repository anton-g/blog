### Open source projects
#### [Quizify](https://github.com/anton-g/quizify)
*2017*  
Work in progress music quiz written in Vue.js with Socket.io. Allows other devices to connect as "buzzers".
#### [kneg](https://github.com/anton-g/kneg)
*2016*  
Started as a toy project in Node.js and finally ended up as a quite capable todo list manager for the command line. You can add tasks, subtasks, tasks with deadlines and mark tasks as complete.

The implementation is a bit naive but I ran it myself for quite some time and never ran into any major issues.

#### [annalka](https://github.com/anton-g/annalka)
*2016*  
jQuery text animation plugin

A small jQuery plugin that animates text updates by randomizing the letters and "morphing" into the new text.
#### [Course Quiz](https://github.com/anton-g/course-quiz)
*2015*  
A multi-choice quiz site. Originally an assignment for multimedia course at Uppsala University but have now been expanded and includes support for different courses and other nifty features.

Written in jQuery and, oh yes, the source is a mess.
